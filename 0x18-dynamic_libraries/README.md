0x18. C - Dynamic libraries
A dynamic library or shared library is a collection of object file witch are launched only during program execution.
This concept reduces the program size and memory use. A shared library is never part of an executable file. A link is created between shared library and executable file. It means that a shared library can be used by any program that needs it. If the library code is updated, it’s not necessary to recompile. It’s location doesn’t move. This method permit to make a green code using less memory.

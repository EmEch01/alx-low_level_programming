Prototypes == Scripts
int _putchar(char c); = The script int _putchar(char c) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _putchar that takes a single argument of type char and returns an integer value.
 The underscore before the function name is a convention used to indicate that the function is not part of the standard library, but is instead a user-defined function.
int _islower(int c); == The script int _islower(int c) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _islower that takes a single argument of type int and returns an integer value. The purpose of this function is to check whether the passed character is a lowercase alphabet (a-z) or not. If the argument passed to _islower is a lowercase alphabet, it returns a non-zero value (true). Otherwise, it returns zero (false)
int _isalpha(int c); The script int _isalpha(int c) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _isalpha that takes a single argument of type int and returns an integer value. The purpose of this function is to check whether the passed character is an alphabet (a to z and A-Z) or not. If the argument passed to _isalpha is an alphabet, it returns a non-zero value (true). Otherwise, it returns zero (false)
int _abs(int n); = The script int _abs(int n) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _abs that takes a single argument of type int and returns an integer value. The purpose of this function is to return the absolute value of the passed integer.
int _isupper(int c); = The script int _isupper(int c) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _isupper that takes a single argument of type int and returns an integer value. The purpose of this function is to check whether the passed character is an uppercase alphabet (A-Z) or not. If the argument passed to _isupper is an uppercase alphabet, it returns a non-zero value (true). Otherwise, it returns zero (false)
int _isdigit(int c);= The script int _isdigit(int c) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _isdigit that takes a single argument of type int and returns an integer value. The purpose of this function is to check whether the passed character is a decimal digit character (0-9) or not. If the argument passed to _isdigit is a decimal digit character, it returns a non-zero value (true). Otherwise, it returns zero (false)
int _strlen(char *s);= The script int _strlen(char *s) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _strlen that takes a single argument of type char pointer and returns an integer value. The purpose of this function is to calculate the length of a given string. The function works by iterating over the characters in the string until it reaches the null character '\0', which marks the end of the string. It then returns the number of characters in the string, excluding the null character
void _puts(char *s); = The script void _puts(char *s) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _puts that takes a single argument of type char pointer and returns nothing (void). The purpose of this function is to print the string pointed to by the argument to the standard output stream, stdout. The function works by iterating over the characters in the string until it reaches the null character '\0', which marks the end of the string. It then prints each character to stdout using the putchar function
char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src); = The script char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _strcpy that takes two arguments of type char pointers and returns a char pointer. The purpose of this function is to copy the contents of the source string to the destination string.
int _atoi(char *s); = The script int _atoi(char *s) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _atoi that takes a single argument of type char pointer and returns an integer value. The purpose of this function is to convert a string of characters that represents an integer to an actual integer value. The function works by iterating over the characters in the string until it reaches the end of the string or a non-numeric character. It then converts the numeric characters to an integer value using arithmetic operations
char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);= The script char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _strcat that takes two arguments of type char pointers and returns a char pointer. The purpose of this function is to concatenate the source string to the end of the destination string. The function works by iterating over the characters in the destination string until it reaches the null character '\0', which marks the end of the string. It then appends each character of the source string to the end of the destination string using the assignment operator. Finally, it adds a null character '\0' at the end of the concatenated string.
char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n); = The script char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n) is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _strncat that takes three arguments of type char pointers and an integer value, and returns a char pointer. The purpose of this function is to concatenate the source string to the end of the destination string, but with a limit on the number of characters to be concatenated. The function works by iterating over the characters in the destination string until it reaches the null character '\0', which marks the end of the string. It then appends each character of the source string to the end of the destination string using the assignment operator, but only up to the first n characters of the source string. Finally, it adds a null character '\0' at the end of the concatenated string.is a function definition in the C programming language. It defines a function named _strncpy that takes three arguments of type char pointers and an integer value, and returns a char pointer. The purpose of this function is to copy the first n characters of the source string to the destination string. The function works by iterating over the characters in the source string until it reaches the end of the string or the first n characters, whichever comes first.
